# The RoomWordsSample App
In this practical the RoomWordsSample app built uses the Android Architecture Components. This app stores a list of words
in a Room database and displays the list in a RecyclerView. The RoomWordsSample app is basic, but sufficiently complete that you can use
it as a template to build on.

The RoomWordsSample app does the following:
Works with a database to get and save words, and pre-populates the database with some words.
Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.
Opens a second Activity when the user taps the + FAB button. When the user enters a word, the app adds the word to the database and then the list updates automatically.
